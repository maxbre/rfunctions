# rfunctions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A mixed collection of my handy R functions.

Beware: all the material must be considered experimental, in full
development, not yet tested.

Caveat emptor: use it at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of 'rfunctions' from the repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/maxbre/rfunctions) with:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxbre/rfunctions")
```
